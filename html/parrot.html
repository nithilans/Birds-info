        <h1>PARROT</h1> <br><br><br>

    </div>
    <div class="section1">
        <p>I read about a parrot that testified in court against the wife of his owner. The wife shot her husband and
            the parrot heard “don’t shoot, don’t shoot” which it repeated in court. The jury convicted her. Could be a
            good reason to have or not have a parrot at home. <br><br><br>

            Parrots were domesticated by the ancient Romans and kept as pets as far back as 5000 years ago in Brazil.
            Parrots first appeared in Europe in 327 B.C. when Alexander the Great conquered India and took Ring-neck
            (Rose-ringed) Parrots and their cousin the Alexandrine Parrot, back to Greece. <br><br><br>

            After the fall of the Roman Empire, parrots were rare in Europe but interest in them rose again after
            Christopher Columbus brought some back after his voyages to the Americas. The first record of a parrot being
            kept as a pet in the British Isles was in 1504 when Henry VIII owned an African Grey Parrot. <br><br><br>

            The Age of Exploration spanned the early 15th century to the early 17th century, during which European ships
            traveled around the world in search of new trading routes. A number of animals were brought back for
            menageries, for study, for museums, as pets, and as curiosities for collections called “cabinets” (a private
            room in a house to which the lord of the manor would retreat to relax and entertain himself with the study
            of curiosities – the first man cave?) Parrots were high on the list. <br><br><br>

            Parrots from India, Africa, and South America were common imports. Not only colorful and easily
            domesticated, they transported relatively easily on the long, uncomfortable sea voyages back to Europe. Few
            people knew anything about the needs of parrots and undoubtedly many birds died in transit. But they
            certainly did much better than more delicate bird species. The records of birds kept in menageries (the
            precursor to zoos), private collections, and bird artwork of the 16th to 18th centuries list, in addition to
            parrots, pheasants, ostriches, rheas, tinamous, and other long-lived and easy to keep birds.</p>
